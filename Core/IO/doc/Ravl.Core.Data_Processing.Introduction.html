    Imaging processing nearly always involves chains of processing
    operations. In languages like C++ many tools for representing and
    abstracting the data and algorithms used.  The language itself is
    designed to be object oriented. It is based on 'C' a procedural
    language.  However some aspects of image processing are more
    easily expressed in terms of the 'data flow' approach. This is
    much harder to express in C++, but with some tools this aspect of
    a program can be clearly expressed. <p>

    In `data flow' program design, the program is modelled as a flow
    of data through several processing operations.  This kind of
    approach is used successfully in unix for piping text between Unix
    processes. <p>

    One of the key design features of the mechanisms described here is
    that they are designed to make the minimum impact on the user
    classes they work with.  The mechanisms work with all the built in
    types of C++, and only require a working copy constructor for most
    of its operations. In addition the assignment operator is used for
    some but not all functionality.  Even if the user's classes do not
    meet weak constraints, it is still possible to use most of the
    mechanisms here, as all kinds of pointers work well within the
    framework.  If the user decides to use raw pointers, memory
    management is left to them. In order to make this possible the C++
    RTTI (Real Time Type Informat) mechanism is used. <p>

    The framework presented here is designed to work with the
    RAVL. C++ programming library.  RAVL uses reference counting to
    manage all large data structures.  This means that the cost of
    using assignment operator and copy constructor can be assumed to
    be low.  This has bearing on the choices made when passing data
    around.  The reference counting mechanism is also thread safe,
    which means several different threads can hold references to an
    object without any problems.  This does not ensure the objects
    themselves are thread safe, however if the data processing model
    is adhered to, the input to a process is never modified and if we
    are only reading information from an object, no conflicts should
    arise. <p>
