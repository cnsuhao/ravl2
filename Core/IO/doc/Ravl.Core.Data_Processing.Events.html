Sometimes we wish to know when the processing of a stream
of data is complete.  This can be done with the DPEventC class.
This class is the result whenever a complete path is constructed,
and thus one can simply assign it to an appropriate variable, as
shown below.   You can either use `completed' to test if
processing has finished, or use the `Wait' method to wait for it.

<TT> DPEventC completed = DPIFileC&lt;RealT&gt;("in.dat") &#187;  DPOffsetScale(4.0,2.0) &#187;= DPOFileC&lt;RealT&gt;("out.dat");
</TT>

<P>
If you wish to wait for a number of pipes to finish, you can
create a set of events with DPEventSetC, and wait for all
of them.
