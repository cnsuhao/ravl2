    The RAVL IO mechanism includes a way of accessing various system
    resources like they were a file, much like devices in /dev under
    UN*X.  In RAVL all virtual devices start with the @
    charactor. They allow you to access things like frame grabbers and
    the display as if it was a file.

    Here's some examples:
    <lu>
      <li><a href="Ravl.GUI.Data_Display.html"><b>@X</b> and <b>@XA</b></a> Used to display images on the screen. </li>
      <li><a href="Ravl.Contrib.Image_IO.Video4Linux.html"><b>@V4L</b> and <b>@V4LH</b></a> Access a video 4 linux frame grabber. (From RAVL's Contrib library) </li>
      <li><a href="Ravl.Contrib.Image_IO.Meteor1.html"><b>@METEOR1</b></a> Access a meteor 1 frame grabber. (From RAVL's Contrib library) </li>
      <li><B>@str</b> Allows a string embeded in a program to read as a file. </li>
