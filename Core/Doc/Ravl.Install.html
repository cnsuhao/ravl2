    <title>RAVL Installation instructions</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p> This document provides a guideline for installation, but has not been
    tested thoroughly.  The instructions are for a Linux environment, using a
    C shell.  However RAVL should also compile under M$ Windows, provided that
    a compiler is used that is broadly ANSI compatible.</p>


    <h2>Compiler installation</h2>

    <p> The RAVL library requires the use of the gcc compiler, version 4.0.2
    or later. If it is not on the system, <a href="Ravl.Compiler.html">install
    it first</a>.</p>

    
    <h2>Installing the RAVL library and applications</h2> 

    <p> Currently we recommend that you <i>don't</i> log in as root for this
    installation.  Decide on a place for the installation and define the
    environment variable <code>RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> accordingly, e.g.:</p>

    <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/src  
    </pre>

    <p>(If using a bash shell, use <code>export</code> instead of
    <code>setenv</code>.) </p>

    <p> The RAVL library and executables can then be installed as follows
    (selecting the relevant <code>config.local.xxx</code> file if not a
    standard Linux 32-bit installation):</p>

    <pre>
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ravl/main/Ravl
cp Ravl/QMake/config.local.linux .</pre>

    <p>  Then edit the chosen <code>config.local.xxx</code>.
    Typical modifications include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> picking up the correct compiler if a new one has been
        installed, or adding <code>ccache</code></li> 

      <li> adjusting the available resources.  The packages in the
      Ravl/Contrib directory all depend on external libraries.  Different
      operating systems have different sets of these libraries.  Most of them
      are turned off by default.  It is probably best to leave them turned off
      when first installing RAVL.  Here is an <a
      href="Ravl.Config.Example.html">example</a> of some edits from an actual
      installation.
      </li>
     </ul> 

   

    <p>Finally, the installation is:</p>

    <pre>
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/Ravl
./install $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject auto $RAVL_INSTALLATION/config.local.linux
rehash</pre> 
    
    <p>Put the following alias and variable settings for
    compilation (modified if appropriate) in your .cshrc file:</p>

    <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/src
setenv PROJECT_OUT ~/ProjOut
alias qm 'make -f $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/RAVL/QMake/QMake.mk USERBUILD=1'
set path = ($path $PROJECT_OUT/lib/RAVL/linux/bin $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/bin)
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>$PROJECT_OUT controls the directory into which your own code
    will be compiled.</li>
      <li>qm is the alias for building your own code.</li>
      <li><code>/vol/ai</code> is the
    directory in which extra packages were installed in the above example
    (and may therefore be superfluous).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Locally-built documentation for the RAVL classes can then be found at:
      <nobr><code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/doc/RAVL/Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.html</code></nobr></p>
