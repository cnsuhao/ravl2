    <title>RAVL Installation instructions</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p> This document provides a guideline for installation, but has not been
    tested thoroughly.  The instructions are for a Linux environment, using a
    C shell.  However RAVL should also compile under M$ Windows, provided that
    a compiler is used that is broadly ANSI compatible.</p>

    <p> The installation process by default will build several versions of the
    library, including varying degrees of optimisation and debug information,
    and also including shared and static versions.</p>

    <h2>RAVL Prerequisites</h2>

    <p> The RAVL library requires the use of the gcc compiler, version 4.0.2
    or later. If it is not on the system, <a href="Ravl.Compiler.html">install
    it first</a>.</p>

    <p>The gtk library is strongly recommended.  Much of RAVL will not build if gtk is not installed.</p>

    
    <h2>Installing the RAVL library and applications</h2> 

    <p> Currently we recommend that you <i>don't</i> log in as root for this
    installation.  Decide on a place for the installation and define the
    environment variable <code>RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> accordingly, e.g.:</p>

    <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/src  
    </pre>

    <p>(If using a bash shell, use <code>export</code> instead of
    <code>setenv</code>.) </p>

    <p> The RAVL library and executables can then be installed as follows
    (selecting the relevant <code>config.local.xxx</code> file if not a
    standard Linux 32-bit installation):</p>

    <pre>
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ravl/main/Ravl
cp Ravl/QMake/config.local.linux .</pre>

    <p>  Then edit the chosen <code>config.local.xxx</code>.
    Typical modifications include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> turning off some of the library versions via the
      <code>FULLBUILD_TARGETS</code> variable (especially if space is limited
      - a full install currently uses about 2Gbyte):
        <ul>
          
          <li><code>debug</code> - includes debugging information and array
          bound checking</li>

          <li><code>check</code> - includes array bound checking</li>

          <li><code>opt</code> - generates optimised code with no array bound
          checking</li>

          <li><code>debugshared, checkshared, optshared</code> - builds shared
          versions of the above.  These link faster </li>

          <li><code>optbin</code> - builds application binaries - including
          <code>CxxDoc</code>, the program that builds this documentation.  So
          if you turn <code>optbin</code> off, you need to build
          <code>CxxDoc</code> separately to get a complete installation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> picking up the correct compiler if a new one has been installed, or
      incorporating <code>ccache</code></li>

      <li> adjusting the available resources using the <code>RESOURCES</code>
      variable.  The packages in the <code>Ravl/Contrib</code> directory all
      depend on various external libraries; different operating systems have
      different sets of these libraries.  Most of them are turned off by
      default.  It is probably best to leave them turned off when first
      installing RAVL.  Also if your system doesn't have for example
      <code>gtk</code>, needed by the RAVL <code>GUI</code> module, that needs
      turning off.  Here is an <a href="Ravl.Config.Example.html">example</a>
      of some edits from an actual installation.
      </li>
     </ul> 

   

    <p>Finally, the installation is:</p>

    <pre>
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/Ravl
./install $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject auto $RAVL_INSTALLATION/config.local.linux
rehash</pre> 

    <p>(The <code>rehash</code> is only necessary if using a C-shell.)</p>

    <h2> Usage </h2><a name="USAGE">
    
    </a><p>Put the following alias and variable settings for
    compilation (modified if appropriate) in your .cshrc file:</p>

    <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/src
setenv PROJECT_OUT ~/ProjOut
alias qm 'make -f $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/RAVL/QMake/QMake.mk USERBUILD=1'
setenv PATH = ($PATH:$PROJECT_OUT/lib/RAVL/linux/bin:$RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/bin)
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>RAVL_INSTALLATION must be set as above.</li>

      <li>$PROJECT_OUT controls the directory into which your own code will be
      compiled.</li>

      <li>qm is the alias for building your own code.  Type <code>qm
      help</code> for options for qm.</li>

      <li>The additions to $PATH will include your own executables built using qm, as well as some RAVL utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Locally-built documentation for the RAVL classes can then be found at:
      <nobr><code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/doc/RAVL/Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.html</code></nobr></p>
