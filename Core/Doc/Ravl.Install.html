    <title>RAVL Installation instructions</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p> These instructions are for a Linux environment.  Make sure you use the
    appropriate commands depending on your shell (C or bash).  There are also
    instructions for compiling RAVL under <a
    href="Ravl.Installation.Windows.html">M$ Windows</a>.</p>

    <p> The installation process by default will build several versions of the
    library, including varying degrees of optimisation and debug information,
    and also including shared and static versions of the libraries.</p>

    <p> The instructions are for downloading the current version on the
    SourceForge SVN repository.  If you prefer, you can download the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravl">latest release</a> (select
    "Download"). </p>

    <h2>RAVL Prerequisites</h2>

    <p> The RAVL library requires the use of the gcc compiler, version 4.0.2
    or later. If it is not on the system, <a
    href="Ravl.Installation.Compiler.html">install it first</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Ravl.Installation.Contrib.html">gtk 2.0 library</a> is
    strongly recommended.  Much of RAVL will not build if gtk is not
    installed.</p>

    
    <h2>Installing the RAVL library and applications</h2> 

    <p> Installation of the RAVL library and executables is rather
    non-standard, but seems to work for most people.  Root priviledge is not needed.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>  Decide on a place for the installation and define the
    environment variable <code>RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> accordingly, e.g. for C shell:

        <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/RavlSrc
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION</pre>

        <p>or for bash shell:</p>

        <pre>
export RAVL_INSTALLATION=~/RavlSrc
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Download the source code:
    <pre>
svn co https://ravl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ravl/main/Ravl</pre>
      </li>

      <li> Select the relevant <code>config.local</code> file from
      <code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/Ravl/QMake</code> as follows.  Determine the
      correct suffix for the file by running:
<pre>
$RAVL_INSTALLATION/Ravl/QMake/config.arc</pre> 

        For a standard Linux installation on a 32-bit machine the returned
        string should be <code>linux</code>, and so the required config file
        is <code>config.local.linux</code> (<code>config.local.linux64</code>
        for a 64-bit machine).  (If the script generates an error message you
        will need to hack it to match your installation.  Sorry.)  In what
        follows it is referred to as <code>config.local.xxx</code>.  Then:
    <pre>
cp Ravl/QMake/config.local.xxx .</pre></li>

      <li>  Then edit the chosen copied <code>config.local.xxx</code>.
    Typical modifications include:
        <ul>
          <li> turning off some of the library versions via the
          <code>FULLBUILD_TARGETS</code> variable (especially if space is
          limited - a full install currently uses about 2Gbyte):
            <ul>
          
              <li><code>debug</code> - includes debugging information and array
                bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>check</code> - includes array bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>opt</code> - generates optimised code with no array
              bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>debugshared, checkshared, optshared</code> - builds
              shared versions of the above.  These link faster </li>
              
              <li><code>optbin</code> - builds application binaries -
              including <code>CxxDoc</code>, the program that builds this
              documentation.  So if you turn <code>optbin</code> off, you need
              to build <code>CxxDoc</code> separately to get a complete
              installation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> picking up the correct compiler if a new one has been installed, or
            incorporating <code>ccache</code></li>
          
          <li> adjusting the available resources using the
          <code>RESOURCES</code> variable.  The packages in the <code><a
          href="Ravl.Installation.Contrib.html">Ravl/Contrib</a></code>
          directory all depend on various external libraries; different
          operating systems have different sets of these libraries.  Most of
          them are turned off by default.  It is probably best to leave them
          turned off when first installing RAVL.  Also if your system doesn't
          have for example <code>gtk</code>, needed by the RAVL
          <code>GUI</code> module, that needs turning off. </li>

          
        </ul> 

        Here is an <a href="Ravl.Installation.Config.html">example</a> of some
        edits from an actual installation.</li>
      
      
      <li>Finally, the installation is:

        <pre>
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/Ravl
./install $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject auto $RAVL_INSTALLATION/config.local.xxx
rehash</pre> 
    (<code>rehash</code> is only necessary if using a C-shell.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <p>If the install fails (usually because libraries that are required in  <code>config.local.xxx</code> are not actually installed), then after fixing the problem it is usually sufficient to simply re-run the <code>./install ...</code> command.  However, if this leads to further compilation errors, you should remove these two directory trees before reinstalling:</p>
    <pre>
$RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject
/tmp/$USER/qm
</pre>

    <h2> Usage </h2><a name="USAGE"></a>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>C shell users</b>: Put the following alias and variable settings
        for compilation (modified if appropriate) in your <code>.cshrc</code>
        file:</p>

        <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/RavlSrc
setenv PROJECT_OUT ~/ProjOut
alias qm 'make -f $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/RAVL/QMake/QMake.mk USERBUILD=1'
setenv PATH  ${PATH}:${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux/bin:${RAVL_INSTALLATION}/RavlProject/bin
</pre></li>
      <li>
        <p><b>bash users</b>: Put the following alias and variable settings
        for compilation (modified if appropriate) in your <code>.bashrc</code>
        file:</p>

        <pre>
export RAVL_INSTALLATION=~/RavlSrc
export PROJECT_OUT=~/ProjOut
alias qm='make -f $RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/RAVL/QMake/QMake.mk USERBUILD=1'
export PATH=${PATH}:${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux/bin:${RAVL_INSTALLATION}/RavlProject/bin
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RAVL_INSTALLATION <i>must</i> be set to the same as for the
      installation above.</li>

      <li>$PROJECT_OUT controls the directory into which your own code will be
      compiled.</li>

      <li>qm is the alias for building your own code.  Type <code>qm
      help</code> for options for qm.</li>

      <li>The additions to $PATH will include your own executables built using qm, as well as some RAVL utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Locally-built documentation for the RAVL classes can then be found at:
      <nobr><code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/RavlProject/share/doc/RAVL/Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.html</code></nobr></p>

    <p>Now you are <a href="Ravl.Introduction.Getting_Started.html">ready to program</a> using the RAVL library and QMake make system.</p>
