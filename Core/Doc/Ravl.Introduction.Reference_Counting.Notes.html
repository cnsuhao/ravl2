    <h1>When should I make my class a big object class?  Why?</h1>

(from an email from Charles Galambos)

    <h2>Basic Reasons:</h2>
<ol>
<li> It's a way of managing memory, freeing it only when all pointers are
removed. In this role it avoids a lot of the problems with accessing freed
memory and memory leaks.

<li> Like using pointers - it allows you to pass around large objects as a
pointer instead of doing lots of copying.

<li> There are also some side benefits when overriding operators on a
class.  It allows you to define arithmetic operators on your class which 
is dangerous or impossible with pointers as it conflicts with the build 
in type operators.

<li> It gives a clear boundary between the implementation of the class's
functionality and the interface the user is expected to use.  Though only a
conceptual advantage, it helps significantly in larger programs.
</ol>

This means:
<ul>
<li> You can return large allocated objects from functions.

<li> You need <i>never</i> see a pointer in your high level code. (Though
 in implementing containers etc. they still have a place.)

<li> When implementing containers etc. you can assume objects assignments are
cheap and trivial.  This make their implementation a lot cleaner and easier to
understand.

<li> It gives a clear framework for implementing advanced C++ constructs like
virtual constructors.
</ul>

    <h2>Hints and tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li> If you define a new object that only contains <b>one</b> other big object
then you can write all the functionality into the handle and do without the
body class.  (I.e. create it as a small object, not a big one.)

<li> If you have several member objects which are all big then you can do
without a body class <b>only</b> if there is no way to assign directly to any
of these objects.  This avoids `schizophrenic' classes where different handles
have different combinations of member data.

<li> <b>Never</b> return a handle to a local instance of a big object as a
reference: this can seriously break the code used to implement big objects and
cause all sorts of problems.

<li> Never use pointers to handles - it can get very confusing and is not
needed.

<li> When writing a big objects all virtual functions should be in 
 the body class, <b>not</b> the handle class. This is a common mistake for
 beginners and can lead to some very strange behaviour.
</ul>

    <h2>Writing big objects:</h2>
<p> The easiest way to write a big object is to derive the body from
RCBodyC and then the handle for RCHandleC<body-name>.  This
automatically provides all the functionality you need.  

<!-- <p> There is also a program called <code>doClassWizard</code> which will write
a skeleton big object class for you.  You can then edit this to your
requirements.  Try <code>doClassWizard -class MyClass</code> and have a look in
the directory <code>./MyClass</code>.  You should be able to compile the code
in this directory with the command <code>am</code> (NB: due to a minor bug
this is not true at the moment.) -->
