    <title>2-D Coordinate Systems in RAVL</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      In the image processing community the usual convention is that, in a
      2-D image coordinate system, the <i>x</i> axis is pointing horizontally
      to the right, and the <i>y</i> axis is pointing vertically downwards,
      i.e. a clockwise coordinate system. </p>
    
    <P>
      On the other hand, 2-D RAVL objects such as arrays, matrices and images,
      the indices are in the order: row, column (as in conventional matrix
      notation).  In pairs of reals (e.g. 2-D vectors and points), the
      components are in the order <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>.  Normally these two
      categories of objects do not interact.  However, when they do (e.g. if
      we want to construct an <SAMP><a
      href="../Class/RavlN.Index2dC.html">Index2dC</a></SAMP> pixel position
      from a <SAMP><a href="../Class/RavlN.Point2dC.html">Point2dC</a></SAMP>
      position vector), the outcome in RAVL is this:
    </P>
    
    <ul>
      <li> The <b>row</b> index is associated with the <b><i>x</i></b> value
      <li> The <b>column</b> index is associated with the <b><i>y</i></b> value
    </ul>
    
    <P>
      The implication is that RAVL adopts a 2-D coordinate system in which the
      <i>x</i> coordinate points downwards, and the <i>y</i> coordinate to the
      right.  The opposite of what you were expecting?  It was done like this
      with the best of intentions to create a consistent system.  It has the
      advantages that:
    </P>
    
    <ul> 
      <li> the coordinate system is anti-clockwise, as is conventional in mathematics
      <li> the first array coordinate is associated with the first vector component etc.
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus you can <em>always</em> make these associations in RAVL: "<i>x</i>,
      <i>y</i>" &hArr; "vector[0], vector[1]" &hArr; "rows, columns" &hArr;
      "down, across".</p>

    <p>
      However we recognise that this convention has confused almost everyone.
      We decided that changing x and y was too dangerous, so our compromise
      has been to remove the symbols <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> wherever possible
      and replace them with "row" and "col".</p>
