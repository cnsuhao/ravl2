    <title>2D Coordinate Systems in RAVL</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    
    <P>
      In 2D RAVL objects, such as arrays, matrices and images, the
      indices are in the order: row, column (as in conventional matrix
      notation).  In pairs of reals (e.g. 2D vectors and points), the
      components are in the order <i>x</i>, w<i>y</i>.  Normally these
      two categories of objects do not interact.  However, when they
      do (e.g. if we want to construct a pixel position, an 
      <SAMP><a href="../Class/RavlN.Index2dC.html">Index2dC</a></SAMP> from a
      <SAMP><a href="../Class/RavlN.Point2dC.html">Point2dC</a></SAMP>), the
      RAVL convention is this:
    </P>
    
    <ul>
      <li> The <b>row</b> index is associated with the <b><i>x</i></b> value
      <li> The <b>column</b> index is associated with the <b><i>y</i></b> value
    </ul>
    
    <P>
      The implication is that RAVL adopts a 2D coordinate system in which the
      <i>x</i> coordinate points downwards, and the <i>y</i> coordinate to the right.
      Not what you were expecting?  It has the advantages that:
    </P>
    
    <ul> 
      <li> the coordinate system is anti-clockwise, as is conventional in mathematics
      <li> the first array coordinate is associated with the first vector component etc.
    </ul>
