<pre>
- some quick notes on building RAVL on Microsoft Windows.

<b>Prerequisites:</b> RAVL Requires Visual Studio 2005, with Visual C++, to
compile.


1) I'd recommend <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">tortoisesvn</a> for dealing with subversion repositories on Windows
-- it's very nice!

Then you'll need to check out the following repository to a directory on your
hard drive.  I use C:\src\Ravl

  https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ravl/main/Ravl


2) To compile RAVL you need a few libraries: luckily they've been put
together into one package 'Glade for Windows'

Can be found at: http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/

Download the latest package called: 'Gtk+/Win32 Development Environment'

Install it to: C:\GTKWIN32 (this isn't the default install location, but it's
where the project files are configured to look)


3) You should be able to open Visual Studio, then open the solution file in
C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\Ravl.sln

Then select 'Build Solution' in the usual way.  


The libraries are built to: C:\Build

You can build executables by including the appropriate project files from
C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\Mains, C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\Examples, or C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\Tests.
You will have to set the library dependencies manually -- a list of the direct
dependencies can be found in the defs.mk files in the same directory as the
source for the executable.

If you want to build a separate project using RAVL you'll have to add two
include paths.  C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\include\Win32 and C:\src\Ravl\MSVC\include,
in that order.
