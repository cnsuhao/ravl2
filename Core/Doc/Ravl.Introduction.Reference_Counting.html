<!-- *************************** Main Page Text  *************************** -->

<P>
When using RAVL for the first time, you'll find there's a few surprises,
such as when dealing with <EM>BIG</EM> and <EM>SMALL</EM> objects.
This page will give details on:

<h2><a name="BIG">The Distinction Between Big and Small Objects</a></h2>

<P>
The main difference is in the way the assignment operator and copy
constructor work.  Small objects behave like basic 'C++' types, in
that a new instance of the object is created with every new variable
and a full copy with each assignment operation.  Big objects behave
more like pointers: assignment only copies the pointer to the body of
the class.  This allows you to have more than one handle to a class.
The object itself is stored in the heap.  All the problems of
allocating and deallocating space on the heap are invisibly handled
for you.

<P>This may seem a bit confusing so here's an example:

<FONT SIZE=4>
<pre>
 int x,y;   // Create two variables.
 x = 2;     // Assign the value 2 to x.
 y = x;     // Copy x to y.
 y++;       // Increment y.
</pre>
</FONT>

<P>
As you would expect this code fragment leaves with x == 2 and y == 3.
Now let's use an integer array from RAVL:
</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
<pre>
 Array1dC&lt;int&gt; x(1),y(1); // Create a one element array.
 x[0] = 2;            // Assign value 2 to first element.
 y = x;               // x and y are now handles to the same object.
 y[0]++;              // This is now the same as x[0]++
</pre>
</FONT>

<P>
This code leaves x[0] == 3 and y[0] == 3.  If you wish assignment to make an
actual copy of the object you must do so explicitly:
</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
<pre>
 Array1dC&lt;int&gt; x(1),y(1); // Create a one element array.
 x[0] = 2;             // Assign value 2 to first element.
 y = x.Copy();         // y is now a copy of x.
 y[0]++;      
</pre>
</FONT>

<P>
This behaves as the first example leaving with x == 2 and y == 3.  Using the
copy constructor with big objects behaves in exactly the same was as the 
assignment operator.  
</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
<pre>
 Array1dC&lt;int&gt; x(1); // Create a one element array.
 Array1dC&lt;int&gt; y(x); // Create y with copy constructor.
 x[0] = 2;           // Assign value 2 to first element of x.
 y[0]++;             // x[0] is now equal to 3.
</pre>
</FONT>

<h2><a name="BIGBEHAVE">Which objects are big objects?</a></h2>

<P> Anything that inherits <code>RCHandleC</code> or <code>BufferAccessC</code> is big.  On the whole, objects of size unknown at compile time are big objects, such as VectorC, MatrixC, DListC and ImageC.  Objects of fixed size are generally small, e.g. Vector2dC and Matrix2d2C.  Exceptions are <code>HashC, HSetC</code> (small) and <code>StringC</code> (more or less small).
</P>


<p>A note of caution: in cases where a big object inherits <code>RCHandleC</code> (the normal way of constructing a big object), if the default constructor is used to create the object, most of the object's methods will cause a segmentation error.  The IsValid() method is an exception, because it is a method if the inherited  <code>RCHandleC</code>, and can be used to test for this situation.  </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="COPY">Copying nested templated big objects</a></h2>

What happens if I use the <code>Copy()</code> function to copy for example an
array of images? - like this:
<pre>
Array1dC&lt;ImageC&lt;RealT&gt; &gt; a1(6), a2;
.... // initialise the images in a1
.... 
a2 = a1.Copy();
....
</pre>
What exactly gets copied here?  In fact only the array gets copied, not the
images themselves; i.e. you get a new array in <code>a2</code> which contains
pointers to the original images in <code>a1</code>.  If you want a "deep" copy,
so that all of the images in the array get copied into new images, you have to
do it explicitly:
<pre>
a2 = a1.Copy();
for (IndexC i=a1.IMin(); i&lt;=a1.IMax(); ++i)  a2[i] = a1[i].Copy();
</pre>
(If you have a large array, you can do the iteration more efficiently using an
array iterator, in this case <code><a
href="../Class/RavlN.Array1dIter2C.html">Array1dIter2C</a></code>.)

<h2><a name="WRITING">Writing your own big objects</a></h2>


    <p> If you are wondering when you should use a big object when writing a
    class yourself, here are <a
    href="Ravl.Introduction.Reference_Counting.Notes.html">some notes from
    Charles Galambos</a>.</p>

    <p>There is is an example of how to write a basic big object in the
    example included <a href=
    "Ravl.API.Core.Reference_Counting.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p> There is also a "<a href=
    "Ravl.API.Source_Tools.Class_Wizard.html">class wizard</a>" that removes
    some of the tedium.  If you write the body of the class,

 <a href= "../Application/cwiz.html">cw&#105;z</a> 

will write the corresponding handle
    for you.</p>
