    These classes are intended to provide <b>basic</b> XML stream
    handing. This allows RAVL programs to read and write XML files
    without including 3rd party libraries. If you want to do any
    operations involving DTD's it is suggested you look at one of the
    many existing libraries that can be found on the web.  If there is
    demand for this functionality a RAVL wrapper class for one of
    these libraries may well be added to the RAVL Contrib code base.
