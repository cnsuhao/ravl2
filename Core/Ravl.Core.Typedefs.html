    There are a few typedef's commonly used in RAVL code. These make
    it easier to port code transparently between different platforms
    as it allows you to make assumptions about types you can't make
    about the standard 'C' types.  e.g. In RAVL IntT is guarantee'd to
    always be at least a 32-bit interger. <p></p>
    
    Its also worth noting the <a href="../Class/RavlN.IndexC.html">IndexC</a> 
    class, this has been introduced to as a work around for the many
    problems that can arrise from C's rounding and sign conversion
    rules. For more details see <a href="../Class/RavlN.IndexC.html">IndexC's documentation</a>. <p></p>
    
    Following is a summary of the most commonly used typedef's:
    
    <ol>
      <li><b>IntT</b> - A signed interger with at least 32 bit representation. </li>
      <li><b>UIntT</b> - An unsigned interger with at least 32 bit representation. </li>
      <li><b>ByteT</b> - An unsigned char of at least 8 bits. </li>
      <li><b>SByteT</b> - A signed char of at least 8 bits. </li>
      <li><b>Int16T</b> - An signed integer of exactly 16 bits. </li>
      <li><b>UInt16T</b> - An unsigned integer of exactly 16 bits. </li>
      <li><b>RealT</b> - A floating point value of at least 64 bits and that provides fast arithmetic.  </li>
      <li><b>RealT</b> - A floating point value of at least 32 bits.  </li>
      <li><b>SizeT</b> - An unsigned integer which enough precision to represent the size of the largest array that can be created in a program on the machine.  </li>
      
    </ol>
