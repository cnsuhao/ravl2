    <title>Threading locks for Core</title>

  <body>
These functions are designed to provide just enough functionality to
ensure that the core library is thread safe.  Full threading
functionality will be provided elsewhere. <p> These functions are
transparently enabled when the RAVL threads library <b>RavlThreads</b>
is linked into a program.

Id 0 is a general system lock. <br>
Id 1 is used for locking the random number generator. <br>
Id 2 is used for non-reentrant 'C' library calls. <br>
Id 3 is reserved for use in RavlLogic. <br>
