    These classes provide a flexible method for handling function and
    method pointers. They have many of the advantages of using 
    <a href="Ravl.OS.Threads.Signals.html">Signals</a> in that you don't
    have to know the exact form a function pointer, but without the
    complexity.
    
    <h3>Using triggers </h3>
    
    Triggers are the simplest form of call. They allow an function
    with arbitrary set of parameters to be called on an event. It is
    used in classes such as 
    <a href="../Class/RavlN.TimedTriggerQueueC.html">TimedTriggerQueueC</a>
    to call a method after a fixed delay, and in 
    <a href="../Class/RavlN.TickerTrigger.html">TickerTriggerC</a> which
    calls a method repeatedly at a fixed frequency.
    <p>
      Creating a trigger is simple:
<pre>
#include "Ravl/Trigger.hh"

TriggerC myTrigger;
</pre>
    
    You can assign a function to it using the <b>Trigger</b> call.

<pre>
bool PrintNumber(int &amp;i) {
  cout << "PrintNumber called with value " << i << "\n";
  return true;
}

myTrigger = Trigger(&amp;PrintNumber,2);
</pre>
    
   Calling the function can be done with the () operator.
    
<pre>
myTrigger();
</pre>
