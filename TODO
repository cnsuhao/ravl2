TODO:

- Improve scripting support.
- Change documentation to Doxygen.
- Improve STL compatibility. Make STL the default container where sensible.
- Improve make system. add standard makefiles and use ./configure
- Make binary streams work seemlessly between 64 bit and 32 bit machines.
- Remove any code marked Obsolete.
- Give WarpAffine and WarpProjective a consistent interface
- Remove pointer array for multi dimensional arrays
- Fix files names so they match the class they contain.

General goals:

 Keep it as easy as possible for people to start programming in.
 Simple things should be simple, complicated should be possible.

 Make more use of STL idioms so that people who come from the background
 feel more at ease with RAVL this should also make interoperating with
 other C++ class libraries easier.

 Ideally moving code from V1 to V2 should be kept as easy as possible,
 clear signs of things breaking where incompatible changes have been made.

 And some compatibility methods where allowing for changes would otherwise
 cause excessive work.

 I'd also like to suggest we do some unit test's against code in the
 'Development' area where contributors wish it and try and keep that code
 working with any changes made.
