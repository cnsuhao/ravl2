TODO:

- Make binary work seemlessly between 64 bit and 32 bit machines.
- Remove any code marked Obsolete.
- Give WarpAffine and WarpProjective a consistant interface
- Improve STL compatibility. Make STL the default container where sensible.
- Remove pointer array for multi dimensional arrays
- Improve scripting support.
- Change documentation to Doxygen.
- Improve make system. add standard makefiles and use ./configure
- Fix files names so they match the class they contain.

General goals:

 Keep it as easy as possible for people to start programming in.
 Simple things should be simple, complicated should be possible.

 Make more use of STL idioms so that people who come from the background
 feel more at ease with RAVL this should also make interoperating with
 other C++ class libraries easier.
