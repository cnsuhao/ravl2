    <p> The centre of the kernel for these operators is assumed to be the
    origin (0,0). So the kernel for a 7 by 7 <i>separable</i> filter would be a 1-D
    array with an index range from -3 to 3.  This can be
    conveniently initalised by one of these methods: </p>

    <pre>
Array1dC &lt;RealT&gt; coeffs;
StrIStreamC ("-3 3 1 3 5 7 5 3 1") >> coeffs;
</pre>

<pre>
static RealT values[7] = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
Array1dC &lt;RealT&gt; coeffs(values, IndexRangeC(-3,3), false);
</pre>
    <p> Since these filters are area-based, the resulting image is smaller
    than the original.  If this is not what is needed, the original image
    should be expanded before filtering, e.g. by using one of the <a
    href="#ExtendImage">ExtendImage functions</a> below. </p>
