LICENSE
-------

The RAVL libraries are distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE (LGPL), however some of the tools built with the library have
been issued under the more restrictive GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, the
headers attached to each of the files in the project indicate which of
these apply.

It should be noted that this library is still in development so
interfaces may change in future releases. RAVL is split up into
modules some of which are more stable than others, following is
summary of the current status.


INSTALLATION
------------

To use the Contrib code, before building the RAVL libraries unpack the
contrib.tar file in the root of your RAVL source tree, a new directory 
'Contrib' should appear.  You can then install RAVL as usual and it 
will include the Contrib code.
