    <title>3D Voxel Carving</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Given silhouettes of an object from multiple camera views, this library computes the
    maximum volume in 3D space which may have produced them.  It requires calibration
    parameters for the camera views to be known 
    - see <a href="Ravl.API.3D.Camera_Calibration.html">camera calibration</a>.</p>

    <p>Code is designed to be fast, for real-time carving.  Carving is done using 
      a pre-computed lookup table based on the camera parameters.</p>

    <p><a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.VoxelSetC.html">VoxelSetC</a> is the data structure which 
      represents an occupied volume in space.  To carve this based on a set of calibrated cameras, use
      <a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.VoxelCarveC.html">VoxelCarveC</a>.  
      A lookup table is created on construction, so expect the constructor to take many 
      seconds or even minutes depending on the size of the voxel set. 
      Once constructed, the 
      <a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.VoxelCarveC.html#UpdateObSArray1dCStImageCStByteTBtBtCb_">
	VoxelCarveC::Update(...)</a> method 
      will quickly compute the occupied volume given any set of silhouette images.  
      The current implementation is single-threaded.  Faster multi-thread versions on the way.</p>

    <p>Voxel carving is often used for visualisation.  The VoxelSurfacePoints(...) 
      functions <a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.VoxelSurfacePointsObconst_VoxelSetCCb.html">[1]</a> and 
      "<a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.VoxelSurfacePointsObconst_VoxelSetC_const_SArray1dCLtImageCLtByteRGBAValueCGtGt_const_Pinhole0ArrayC_Amp_const_Vector3dC_AmpCb.html">[2]</a> 
      compute the set of points one the surface of the voxel set, 
      expressed as a <a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.PointSetC.html">PointSetC</a>.  
      This can be rendered in OpenGL using <a href="../Class/RavlGUIN.DPointSetC.html">RavlGUIN::DPointSetC</a>.
