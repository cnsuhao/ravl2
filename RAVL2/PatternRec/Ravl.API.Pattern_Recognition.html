    <h3>Tools for constructing classifiers and data models and evaluating their performance.</h3>
    

    <p>These tools are designed to operate within a common object-oriented framework.  The exceptions are those in <a href="Ravl.API.Pattern_Recognition.Optimisation2.html">Optimiser classes II</a>, which were designed as a separate project.</p>
