The interface to DPIPortC&lt;DataT&gt; is fairly simple. There is a
function `bool IsGetReady()' to test if any data is immediately
available.  `bool IsGetEOS()', tests if the end of the stream has been
reached. Finally there is `bool Get(DataT &amp;buf)' which retrieves data
from the stream. It returns false if for whatever reason it fails.
The interface to DPOPortC&lt;DataT&gt; is fairly simple. `bool
IsPutReady()' tests if a stream is ready to accept data and `bool
Put(const DataT &amp;dat)' to send it.

<P>
There are several implementations of input and output in RAVL.  These
include ones that use the standard C++ istream and ostream.  There is
a binary version of these operators, BinIStreamC and BinOStreamC,
for a more compact (machine independent) representation.  In addition
there are numerous type-specific formats which will be discussed in section
<A HREF="Ravl.API.Core.IO.Formats.html">Ravl.API.Core.IO.Formats</A>.

<P> 
All data processing port objects inherit an <a href="Ravl.API.Core.Data_Processing.Attributes.html"> attribute handling mechanism. </a>  

<P>
Typical examples of such routines are DPOFileC&lt;&gt; and DPIFileC&lt;&gt;
which use the standard C++ stream class and operators, `operator&#187;
(istream &amp;,ClassT &amp;x)' and `operator&#171; (ostream &amp;,const ClassT
&amp;x)' to load and save a set of objects to a file.  These are
described in most C++ text books, so we will not go into any detail here.
