    <title>RAVL Installation instructions</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p> These instructions were developed for a Linux environment.  They
    should work for most Unix-type environments.  There are also instructions
    for compiling RAVL under <a href="Ravl.Installation.Windows.html">M$
    Windows</a>.</p>

    <p> The installation process by default will build several versions of the
    library, including varying degrees of optimisation and debug information,
    and also including shared and static versions of the libraries.</p>

    <p> The instructions are for downloading the current version on the
    SourceForge SVN repository.  If you prefer, you can download the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravl">latest release</a> (select
    "Download"). </p>

    <h2>RAVL Prerequisites</h2>

    <p> The RAVL library requires the use of the gcc compiler.  Use either
    version 3.4.6, or a stable release of version 4. If it is not on the
    system, <a href="Ravl.Installation.Compiler.html">install it
    first</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Ravl.Installation.Contrib.html">gtk 2.0 library</a> is
    strongly recommended.  Much of RAVL will not build if gtk is not
    installed.</p>

    
    <h2>Installing the RAVL library and applications</h2> 

    <p> Installation of the RAVL library and executables is rather
    non-standard, but seems to work for most people.  Root priviledge is not
    needed.</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Make sure you use the appropriate commands depending on your shell
      (C or bash).  Decide on a place for the installation and define the
      environment variable <code>RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> accordingly.  This
      can optionally point to an existing directory.  For C shell:

        <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/RavlProject
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src</pre>

        <p>or for bash shell:</p>

        <pre>
export RAVL_INSTALLATION=~/RavlProject
mkdir -p $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Download the source code:
    <pre>
svn co https://ravl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ravl/main/Ravl</pre>
      </li>

      <li> Select the relevant <code>config.local</code> file from
      <code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/src/Ravl/QMake</code> as follows.  Determine
      the correct suffix for the file by running:
<pre>
$RAVL_INSTALLATION/src/Ravl/QMake/config.arc</pre> 

        For a standard Linux installation on a 32-bit machine the returned
        string should be <code>linux</code>, and so the required config file
        is <code>config.local.linux</code> (<code>config.local.linux64</code>
        for a 64-bit machine).  (If the script generates an error message you
        will need to hack it to match your installation.  Sorry.)  In what
        follows the config file is referred to as
        <code>config.local.xxx</code>.  Then:
    <pre>
cp Ravl/QMake/config.local.xxx .</pre></li>

      <li>  Then edit the chosen copied <code>config.local.xxx</code>.
    Typical modifications include:
        <ul>
          <li> turning off some of the library versions via the
          <code>FULLBUILD_TARGETS</code> variable (especially if space is
          limited - a full install currently uses about 2Gbyte):
            <ul>
          
              <li><code>debug</code> - includes debugging information and array
                bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>check</code> - includes array bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>opt</code> - generates optimised code with no array
              bound checking</li>
              
              <li><code>debugshared, checkshared, optshared</code> - builds
              shared versions of the above.  These link faster </li>
              
              <li><code>optbin</code> - builds application binaries.  Strongly
              recommended to leave it turned on, in order to build
              <code>CxxDoc</code>, the program that builds this documentation.
              If you turn <code>optbin</code> off, you need to build
              <code>CxxDoc</code> separately to get a complete
              installation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> picking up the correct compiler if a new one has been
          installed, or incorporating <code>ccache</code></li>
          
          <li> adjusting the available resources using the
          <code>RESOURCES</code> variable.  The packages in the <code><a
          href="Ravl.Installation.Contrib.html">Ravl/Contrib</a></code>
          directory all depend on various external libraries; different
          operating systems have different sets of these libraries.  Most of
          them are turned off by default.  It is probably best to leave them
          turned off when first installing RAVL.  Also if your system doesn't
          have for example <code>gtk</code>, needed by the RAVL
          <code>GUI</code> module, that needs turning off. </li>

          
        </ul> 

        Here is an <a href="Ravl.Installation.Config.html">example</a> of some
        edits from an actual installation.</li>
      
      
      <li>Finally, the installation is:

        <pre>
cd $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src/Ravl
./install $RAVL_INSTALLATION auto $RAVL_INSTALLATION/src/config.local.xxx
rehash</pre> 
    (<code>rehash</code> is only necessary if using a C-shell.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <p>If the install fails (usually because libraries that are required in
    <code>config.local.xxx</code> are not actually installed), then after
    fixing the problem it is usually sufficient to simply re-run the
    <code>./install ...</code> command.  However, if this leads to further
    compilation errors, you should remove the following directory trees before
    re-running the install script:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Everything in <code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> except <code>src</code></li>
      <li><code>/tmp/$USER/qm</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Usage </h2><a name="USAGE"></a>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>C shell users</b>: Put the following alias and variable settings
        for compilation (modified as appropriate) in your <code>.cshrc</code>
        file:</p>

        <pre>
setenv RAVL_INSTALLATION ~/RavlProject
setenv PROJECT_OUT ~/ProjOut
setenv PATH  ${PATH}:${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux/bin:${RAVL_INSTALLATION}/bin
rehash
</pre></li>
      <li>
        <p><b>bash users</b>: Put the following alias and variable settings
        for compilation (modified if appropriate) in your <code>.bashrc</code>
        file:</p>

        <pre>
export RAVL_INSTALLATION=~/RavlProject
export PROJECT_OUT=~/ProjOut
export PATH=${PATH}:${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux/bin:${RAVL_INSTALLATION}/bin
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION</code> <i>must</i> be set here to the same
      as for the installation above.</li>

      <li><code>$PROJECT_OUT</code> controls the directory into which your own
      code will be compiled.</li>

      <li>The additions to <code>$PATH</code> will include your own
      executables built using qm, as well as some RAVL utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Locally-built documentation for the RAVL classes can then be found at:
    <nobr><code>$RAVL_INSTALLATION/share/doc/RAVL/Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.html</code></nobr></p>

    <p>Now you are <a href="Ravl.Introduction.Getting_Started.html">ready to
    program</a> using the RAVL library and QMake make system.</p>
