    <title>Notes on how the reference counting works</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Each body object includes a reference counter.  In essence, reference counting works like this:</p> <ul>
      <li> each time a new handle to the object is created, the counter is incremented; </li>
      <li> each time a handle is destroyed, the counter is decremented;  </li>
      <li> when the count reaches zero, the body is destroyed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In a typical handle object, the <i>only</i> times the counter is manipulated is as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The handle constructors (including the copy constructor) increment the reference counter. </li>
      <li> The handle copy assignment operator increments the reference counter of the argument and also decrements the counter of the old object.  </li>
      <li> The handle destructor decrements the reference counter.  After decrementing the counter, if the count = 0, the body destructor is called.</li>
</ul>
    <p> Apart from when it is used explicitly, the copy constructor is called:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>  when an object is passed by value as an argument to a function;</li>
      <li>  when an object is returned by value from a function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <i>body</i> copy constructor will only ever be called in a deep copy.</p>
