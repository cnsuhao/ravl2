    <p>This C++ library provides basic classes, together with a range of Image Processing, Vision and Pattern Recognition classes.</p>

    <p>Why should you use this library?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It has a simple user interface: the user does not have to use
      pointers or deal with heap management.  (Java programmers should find the
      interface reasonably familiar.)</li>
      <li>It has an I/O library that supports a wide range of file formats and
      devices in a consistent manner (including image, video and audio).</li>
      <li>It uses reference counting for large objects, making them
      thread-safe for multi-threaded applications</li>
      <li>It is freely available from <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravl">SourceForge</a></li>
      <li>It is distributed under the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
      License</a></li>
      <li>It is straightforward to port to any operating system / platform that
      conforms to the Posix standard and has an ANSII C++ compiler.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Implementation issues:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supports Solaris, Linux, Irix, M$ .NET.</li>

      <li>Only uses other libs if they are under the LGPL.</li>

      <li>The RAVL library is modular, so parts needed for a particular
      applications can be separated out easily.

      <li>The source archive is maintained at <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ravl">SourceForge</a> under <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org">SVN</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some notes: </p>
    <ul>
	<li>
	  There are in fact two versions of this documentation, 'user' and
	  'develop', explained <a
	  href="Ravl.Documentation.html">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In the code you will often see reference to RAVL with only the first
	  letter in upper case, this is to stop the RavlN namespace being
	  confused with a macro definition as set out in the <a
	  href="Ravl.Introduction.Naming_Conventions.html"> naming conventions
	  </a>.
	</li>
</ul>
