INSTALLATION
------------

To use the library you need the mpeg_lib version 1.3.1 you can download
this from http://www.netsw.org/graphic/movie/mpeg/mpeg_lib

once you have down loaded and installed this package edit the LibMPEG.def
file in this directory and build it in the usual way. To include MPEG support
in your program include 'RavlMPEG' in the USESLIBS line of your defs.mk.

Because of limitations of the mpeg_lib library, you can only play back one
mpg file at a time. There are currently no checks on this so the results attempting
this are unpredictable.
