  <body>
    <p>A "contrib" package usually contains classes that are essentially
    wrappers around non-RAVL libraries.  Typically it interfaces to a
    specific piece of hardware or a software package with an
    incompatible license. </p>

    <p>The contrib code is included within RAVL in spite of the dependencies
    on these other libraries.  However when building RAVL the inclusion of
    this code can be turned on or off.  The documentation of any included
    contrib is merged into the overall RAVL tree.
