  <body>
    <p>The "contrib" package contains classes that are essentially
    wrappers around non-RAVL libraries.  Typically it interfaces to a
    specific piece of hardware or a software package with an
    incompatible license. </p>

    <p>The contrib code is not included within
    RAVL because of the dependencies on these other libraries.
    However, once it is installed, the user does not normally notice
    the difference.  The documentation is merged into the overall RAVL tree.
