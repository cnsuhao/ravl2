    <h2>Eigen decomposition or SVD?</h2>
    <p>Eigen decomposition decomposes a matrix M thus:  <pre>   M * E = E * L</pre> where L is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and E is a matrix of eigenvectors.  On the other hand, SVD decomposes M thus: <pre>   M * V = U * D</pre> where D is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and U and V are orthogonal matrices.  In general, D and L are not the same.  But it is easy to show that, <i>for symmetrical matrices</i>, these two decompositions are identical: <code>D = L</code> and <code>U = V = E</code>.  In this case, you have the choice of which to use.  It is generally reckoned that <b>SVD</b> is more stable, and is likely to give a more accurate answer than eigen decomposition.</p>

    <h2>Which eigen decomposition?</h2>
    <p>If you are nevertheless using eigendecomposition, there are currently two algorithms in RAVL: one from the CCMath library and one from the JAMA library.  The CCMath ones are the functions named <code>FastEigen....</code>.  This algorithm is faster, but occasionally fails for ill-conditioned matrices.  The remaining functions are based on the JAMA algorithm implemented in  <a href="../Class/RavlN.EigenValueC.html">EigenValueC</a>.  Note that <code>EigenValueC</code> is templated, so that different floating point representations may be used.</p>
