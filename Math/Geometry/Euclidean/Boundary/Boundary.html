    <p>Boundaries of regions are here represented by the line segments that form the junction between pixels of adjacent regions.  If the image is interpreted as an array of pixels on the form of square tiles, the boundary follows the edges of the tiles.  Thus each element CrackC of a boundary BoundaryC can be considered to be a vector of length 1 pixels, with 4 possible orientations.</p>

    <p> This representation as the gap <i>between</i> the pixels is in contrast to the representation in <a href="Ravl.Images.Edges.html">Edges</a>.</p>
