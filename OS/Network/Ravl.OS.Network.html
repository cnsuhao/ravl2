    There are currently 3 levels of networking support in RAVL.
    <h3>Low level</h3>
    
    SocketC - This class provides low level socket operations associated TCP/IP and DNS networking. It hides the platform specific implementation details.
    
    <h3>Medium Level</h3>
    
    NetIStreamC & NetOStreamC - These allow a network stream to treated much like a file. You can use these to send data across a connection as text with the standard C++ '>>' and '<<' stream operators or wit BinIStreamC and BinOStreamC as machine independant binary.
   
    NetEndPointC - Provides a mechanism for calling methods of a class across the network.
    
    <h3> High level </h3>
    
    <a href="Ravl.OS.Network.NetPort.html">NetPort</a>  This class allows streams of data to exported across the network. e.g. This can be used for transporting the results of image processing, or the raw images from a grabber card.
