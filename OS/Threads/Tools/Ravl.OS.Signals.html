    <title>Thread safe signal handling</title>
  </head>

  <body>

   The RAVL signal system has been inspired by <a href="http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/">libsigc++</a>, but
written to work with RAVL style reference counting. <p>

   Important features:
    <ul>
      <li> Signal objects are refrence counted.
      <li> Adding and removing connections is thread safe.
      <li> The default implementation makes copies of the objects the signal will be delived to,
 enabling it to call methods of refrence counted objects safely.
    </ul>
