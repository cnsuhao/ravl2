    <title>IO for streams of objects</title>
  </head>

  <body>    
    <p>
      Sequences or streams of objects are accessed in RAVL with two
      classes <a href="../Class/RavlN.DPIPortC.html">DPIPortC&lt;&gt;
      </a> and <a href="../Class/RavlN.DPOPortC.html">DPOPortC&lt;&gt;
      </a>. DPIPortC allows sequences of objects to be read in to a
      program and DPOPortC is used for writing them out.  You can
      initialise streams with the <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenISequenceObDPIPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenISequence</a>
      and <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenOSequenceObDPOPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenOSequence</a>
      respectively. 
    <p>
      Following is a example of how to use these classes.      
    <p>
    <h3> Reading a sequence </h3>
    
    <pre>
    DPIPortC&lt;int&gt; in;
    if(!OpenISequence(in,"myfile.abs")) {
      // Failed to open input file.
      // Report an error...
    }
    int value;
    while(in.Get(value)) {
      // Process your data...
    }
    </pre>
    
    <h3> Writting a sequence </h3>
    <pre>
    DPOPortC&lt;int&gt; out;
    if(!OpenOSequence(out,"myfile.abs")) {
      // Failed to open output file.
      // Report an error..
    }
    for(int i = 0;i < 10;i++)
       out.Put(i); // Write some data.
    </pre>
    <h2> Numbered files </h2> 

    It is possible to open a series of numbered files as a
    sequence. This can be done in several ways, by opening the first
    file in the sequence, by open with a filename containing %d in
    place of the number or if the number is before the extension by
    omitting the number entirely. See the sub-section <a
    href="Ravl.OS.Sequence.Numbered_Files.html"> Numbered files</a>
    for more details.
    
    <h2> Type conversion </h2> 
    <p>
      The same system of type conversion is used for streams as for
      the loading and saving of single objects.  For more details on
      how this works and how to implement type converters see <a
      href="Ravl.Core.IO.html">Ravl.Core.IO</a>.
    <p>
    <h2> Seekable streams </h2> 
    <p>
      Often you want both information about where in the stream you
      are, and control over the position from which your going to read
      or write data. This can be done with seekable streams <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPISPortC.html">DPISPortC&lt;&gt; </a> and
      <a href="../Class/RavlN.DPOSPortC.html">DPOSPortC&lt;&gt;
      </a>. They can be used and initalised in the same way as
      DPIPortC and DPOPortC seen previously with <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenISequenceObDPISPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenISequence</a>
      and <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenOSequenceObDPOSPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenOSequence</a>.
    <p>
      These classes have an additional set of member functions which
      allow control of the position in the stream. A description of
      these functions can be found in <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPSeekCtrlC.html">DPSeekCtrlC</a>.  Note: not
      all streams support all these methods, if a sequence doesn't
      support a method your using it will report a failure. It is
      possible to open any sequence in RAVL as a seekable stream,
      though the seek controls will have no effect.
