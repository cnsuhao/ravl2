    <title>Sequences of numbered files</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>There are three ways of opening a numbered sequence of files: by
    opening the first file in the sequence; by opening with a filename
    containing %d in place of the number; or (if the number is before
    the extension) by omitting the number entirely.</p>
    
    <h3> Using %d in the filename.  </h3>

    <p>Using %d you can explicitly set the format of the file name to
      be used. It is used by placing the %d in the filename where the
      number is expected. <b>name%d.xxx</b> can be used to read a
      sequence of files such as:</p>
      
    <pre>name1.xxx name2.xxx name3.xxx</pre> 
    
    <p>If you wish the filenames to be zero padded you can add the
      number of digits between the % and the d. So <b>name%3d.xxx</b>
      can be used to read or write the following files:</p>
      
    <pre>name001.xxx name002.xxx name003.xxx</pre> 
    
    <p>This method is more useful when writing file sequences.</p>  
      
    <h3> Opening the first file in the sequence. </h3> 
      
    <p>If the file being opened cannot be interpreted as a stream
      themselves (such as pnm ) you can just open the first file in
      the sequence and the rest of the sequence will be found
      automatically. So you could open the following sequence:</p> 

    <pre>name001.xxx name002.xxx name003.xxx</pre> 
    
      
    <p>with the filename <b>name001.xxx</b></p>.
      
    <h3>Omitting the number completely. </h3> 
      
    <p>If the filename is in the form <b>nameNNN.XXX</b> where NNN is
      some number and XXX is the extension, the file may be opened as
      <b>name.XXX</b> (provided that no file of that name exists). The
      system will scan the directory for files which conform to this
      format and work out the range of digits, and whether zero padding is
      being used.</p>
