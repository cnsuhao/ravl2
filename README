There are two directories in the repository.

 RAVL2       - All code in this repository should compile. 
 Development - This is intended for code that may form the basis of contributions.

Ideally code in the development directory should be LGPL, or a compatible license. Code under other licenses
may be placed there, but should be clearly labeled both with a file called LICENSE in its root directory and
headers on all the files.

If you wish to add new code to 'Development' in a directory named after your source forge login. We may add
further directories to structure contributions as required.
