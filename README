LICENSE
-------

The RAVL libraries are distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC 
LICENSE (LGPL), however some of the tools built with the library have
been issued under the more restrictive GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, the
headers attached to each of the files in the project indicate which of 
these apply.


INSTALLATION
------------

- The CxxDoc tools currently requires a daft amount of memory to compile,
  approximately 512MB.  If you don't have this much on your machine you 
  can stop the installation by going to the Ravl/SourceTools/defs.mk file
  and removing the `.r' after CxxDoc.   If you still want to use this
  tool you can create a debug version with `qm debug' which will be slow,
  but takes much less memory to compile.

- At the moment you have to manualy configure where to look
  for the compiler. This is done by setting CC and CXX to the locations of
  the C and C++ compilers respectively in the system configuration
  file. The configuration file can be found in Ravl/QMake/config.$(ARC)
  where arc is one of linux,sgi or sol2, depending on your machine.

- The `Math' module requires the ccmath package to be installed. The code
  has been tested with version 2.2.0, but I would expect it to work with   
  older versions as well.  The location of the ccmath package is set
  in Ravl/Math/CCMath/CCMath.def, set the 'CCMATH' variable to appropriate
  directory uncomment two lines following it, and comment out any other
  'EXELIB' lines later in the file. 

- The appropriate version of perl must be in your default path.


To install go the root RAVL directory and type:

./install [location]
