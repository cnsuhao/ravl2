LICENSE
-------

The RAVL libraries are distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC 
LICENSE (LGPL), however some of the tools built with the library have
been issued under the more restrictive GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, the
headers attached to each of the files in the project indicate which of 
these apply.


INSTALLATION UNIX
-----------------

- The CxxDoc tools currently requires a daft amount of memory to compile,
  approximately 512MB.  If you don't have this much on your machine you 
  can stop the installation by going to the Ravl/SourceTools/defs.mk file
  and removing the `.r' after CxxDoc.   If you still want to use this
  tool you can create a debug version with `qm debug' which will be slow,
  but takes much less memory to build.

- At the moment you have to manualy configure where to look
  for the compiler. This is done by setting CC and CXX to the locations of
  the C and C++ compilers respectively in the system configuration
  file. The configuration file can be found in Ravl/QMake/config.$(ARC)
  where arc is one of linux,sgi or sol2, depending on your machine.

- The `Math' module requires the ccmath package to be installed. The code
  has been tested with version 2.2.0, but I would expect it to work with   
  older versions as well.  The location of the ccmath package is set
  in Ravl/Math/CCMath/CCMath.def, set the 'CCMATH' variable to appropriate
  directory uncomment two lines following it, and comment out any other
  'EXELIB' lines later in the file.  

  - A version of the ccmath source code which will compile under QMake is
  included the RAVL releases and as a separate file available for download.
  Using this is NOT guaranteed to give the best code as the QMake release
  does not currently make use of assembler provided with the official package.
  It does make it much easier to install. If you don't wish to use this
  code remove the 'CCMath.r' from the NESTED line in the Ravl/defs.mk file.

- The appropriate version of perl (Tested with 5.005_03) must be in your 
  default path.

- Currently there are problems with using ccmath on IRIX, these are
  being looked at.  If your not interested in the matrix stuff you can
  turn it off by editing ./Ravl/defs.mk and removing the '.r' after the
  'math' in the NESTED line.

To install go the root RAVL directory and type:

./install [location]

NOTE: Most of the development of RAVL is being done on a Redhat 6.2
box with gcc-2.95.2, at this stage in development things are most
likely to work on a similar box.  The installation system should be 
changed to use a 'configure' script, its on my todo list, somewhere.


INSTALLATION FOR VISUAL C++
---------------------------

In order to compile RAVL with Visual C++ you have to persuade Visual
studio to recognised .cc and .hh files as C++ source. The tweeks needed
are described in http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q181/5/06.ASP
