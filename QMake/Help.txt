------- HELP on QMake make system V1.0 ------

Common targets: 
  check     Build binaries and libraries with consistancy checking (Default).
             this is recomended development target.
  debug     Build binaries and code with debug information, but link
            with the check verson of AMMA. This should be quicker than
	    debuging all of AMMA.
  debugfull Build binaries with debug information, link executables with
	    the all available debug information. NB. The executables may
	    be very large.
  opt       Optimised build. 
  shared    Build optimised shared libraries/executables.
  prof      Output optimised code with profiling info suitable for prof.
  gprof     Output optimised code with profiling info suitable for gprof.
  purify    Build all executables in the CURRENT directory with purify.
	     purify executables are prefixed with 'pure_'.  Use only on solaris
	     machines.
  src       Check-out all source, and put headers in the right place.
  clean     Remove all temporary files. (NB. Use VAR=... to set variant.) (See below for details)
    optclean clean with VAR=opt
    dbclean  clean with VAR=debug
    chkclean clean with VAR=check
  cleanlib  Like clean, but removes library as well.  (See below for details)
  cleandep  Remove all dependency files. (See below for details)
  distclean Clean and remove all executables and libraries for current variant 
  doc       Make automatic documentation.
  docentry  Make semantic documentation
  chead     Check headers with original AMMA make system.
  ci	    Check in directory tree. See 'notes' for details.
  lib_info  Tell's you which libraries are needed/used to create an executable.
  listco    RCS: List all files that are check-out in source tree.
  listoff   RCS: List all directories that are turned off.
  listfix   RCS: List all lines in source than contain 'FIXME'. 
  help      Print this help on the QMake system. 
  defs      List of public def's files.
  test	    Compile and run test executables.
  retest    Rerun the final stage of amma testing.
  notes     Print help on more obscure/unstable parts of the QMake system. 

Variables: 
  PROCS    = Number of processors to use. 
  VAR      = check (default), debug, opt 
  AMMA_INFO=1 Print command lines during make. 
  USERCFLAGS=... Pass extra options to the compiler.

Examples: 

  % make qopt
Make optimised version of code, with frozen dependencies.

  % make debug PROCS=1 AMMA_INFO=1 
Make debug version one file at a time, with command lines printed. 

The meaning of clean targets:

  clean    - Removes object files created during compilation for this library
          this forces all objects in the current library to be recompiled.
  cleanlib - Does clean as above, but also removed the library.
  cleandep - Clean dependancy information.  This forces the make system to
          recompute the library dependancies. 
  distclean - Cleans out the entire project out, and all intermediate files.
