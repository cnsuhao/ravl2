    <p>QMake is a flexible compilation aid, based on the GNU "make" program.
    It was originally developed for building the RAVL (and its predecessors)
    library, but it can be used for compiling any software project, however
    big or small.</p>

    <h2>Running QMake</h2>

    <p>The basic command is <code>qm</code>, which is an alias for
    <code>make</code> that is defined when you set up the RAVL
    environment.</p>

    <p>Typing <code>qm</code> with no arguments will build code that contains
    basic checks such as array bound violations.  It will use (and optionally
    create) static libraries. </p>

    <p>There are <a href="../../../html/Help.txt">various other QMake
    command-line options</a> you can use, e.g.: </p>

      <ul>

      <li>The debug options (e.g. <code>qm debug</code>) will build in
      debugging information.</li>

      <li> The optimised versions (e.g. <code>qm opt</code>) produce optimised
      code with no checking.</li>

      <li> You can include (and create) shared rather than static RAVL
      libraries in your executable (e.g. <code>qm shared</code>, <code>qm
      optshared</code>).</li>

      <li>You can list the command-line options at any time by typing <code>
      <a href="../../../html/Help.txt"> qm help</a></code>.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The "defs.mk" file</h2>

    <p>QMake relies on a simple text file ("<code>defs.mk</code>") being
    present in <i>each</i> directory of the project.  Each
    <code>defs.mk</code> contains a set of variables that describe what must
    be compiled <i>from that directory</i>.</p> 

    <p>Information describing the many variables in the <code>defs.mk</code>
    file for controlling what is built is given under <a
    href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html">Description File Variables </a>.  But to begin
    with, all you probably need is one or two of these:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#MAINS">MAINS</a> A list of programs to compile.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#SOURCES">SOURCES</a> Other source files to compile.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#HEADERS">HEADERS</a> Header files for this source code that need to be shared.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#PLIB">PLIB</a> Name of library to be created from the entries in SOURCES.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#PROGLIBS">PROGLIBS</a> Additional libraries only needed for executables defined in MAINS.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a> Libraries needed by the library defined by PLIB.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#NESTED">NESTED</a> Subdirectories to compile.
    </ul>
    <p>E.g. if all you wanted to compile was one file called "fred.cc"
    containing a main program, the defs.mk file would contain the single line:
    </p> <pre>MAINS = fred.cc</pre>

    <p>Any of these variables can also be overridden on the command line,
    e.g.:</p>

    <pre>qm "MAINS = fred.cc"</pre> 

    <p>However a <code>defs.mk</code> file, even if empty, <i>must</i> exist
    in the current directory.</p>


<h2> Advanced Configuration </h2>


<p> QMake uses a configuration file to establish what libraries are available called config.local.(system name) . e.g. config.local.linux.
To avoid problems with changes to the default ravl config files, there is an environment variable which if set redirects QMake to a local
configuration file. This should avoid odd problems with compilers changing unexpectedly, or different libraries being enabled/disabled.
Just added the following to your .cshrc :
</p>

<code>
setenv QMAKECONFIGHOME /vol/src/QMakeConfig
</code>
<p>
or for bash users the following should be added to .bashrc
</p>
<code>
export QMAKECONFIGHOME=/vol/src/QMakeConfig
</code>


<h2>Build Tags</h2>

<p>
If you have several versions of a piece of source code, built to different project outs it is very easy to get 
them confused and build the a piece of code to the wrong place.   To avoid doing this you can use a feature of
QMake called "Build Tags".   This feature attaches a tags your project out, build alias and source tree and then 
checks the tags are consistent before making a directory.
</p>
To use this feature you must:

<ul>
<li> Set BUILD_TAG=(Some tag) in your build alias or shell environment. 
<li> Write a file in the root of your project out called 'buildTag' containing the name of the build
<li> Write a file in the root of the source tree called 'buildTag' containing the name of the build
</ul>
<p>
When you do a build QMake will first go up the source tree looking for the 'buildTag' file, it will use the 
contents of the first one it finds.  It will then check that the value in the file match (less any whitespace) the 
one in the environment variable BUILD_TAG.  It will also check that the buildTag in the project out matches the 
BUILD_TAG value. Only if these two tests pass will QMake execute the compile command.
