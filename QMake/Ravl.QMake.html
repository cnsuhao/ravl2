QMake is a flexible compilation aid, based on the GNU "make" program.
It was originally developed for building the RAVL (and its
predecessors) library, but it can be used for compiling any software
project, however big or small.

<p>QMake relies on a simple text file ("<code>defs.mk</code>") being present in
<i>each</i> directory of the project.  Each <code>defs.mk</code> describes what must be compiled <i>from that directory</i>.
</P>

<P>
The documentation for QMake is fragmented at present:<ul>
<li>Information describing the many variables in the <code>defs.mk</code> file
for controlling what is built is given  <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html">here</a>
(Description File Variables).  But to begin with, all you probably need is one or two of these:<ul>
<li> MAINS
<li> SOURCES
<li> LOCALHEADERS
<li> USESLIBS
<li> NESTED
</ul>
E.g. if all you wanted to compile was one file called "fred.cc" containing a
main program, the defs.mk file would contain the single line: 
<pre>MAINS = fred.cc</pre> 
<li>Type <code>qm</code> to compile (<code>qm</code> is an alias defined in the
RAVL environment).  The <a href="../../../../Tools/QMake/Help.txt">QMake
command-line options</a> describe how to use different modes of QMake.
<!-- <li>Xemacs users: there is an <a href="../html/Ravl-mode.html">Xemacs</a>
enhancement to allow easy QMake compilation from within Xemac. -->
</ul>
