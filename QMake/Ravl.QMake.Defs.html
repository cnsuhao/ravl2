<!-- *************************** Main Page Text  *************************** -->

<P>
The "defs.mk" description file is used by QMake to determine what files are to
be processed when building the current directory. It achieves this by setting
various variables. These fall into several categories listed on the right.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;
<P>&nbsp;
<P>&nbsp;
<P>&nbsp;



<H3><A NAME="description"></A>Directory Description</H3>

<P>
The automatic documentation system requires a one line description of each
directory in your project. This is defined as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION</B></DT>
<DD>A one line description of the directory contents. This should give potential
 users an idea about the functionality that this directory contributes to
 the project.
</DD>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME="multiple"></A>Multiple Directory Packages</H3>

<P>
The QMake system is capable of building a tree of directories. The
following variable is used to specify the branches from the current directory.

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="NESTED"></A><B>NESTED</B></DT>
<DD>The list of subdirectories which are built before the current directory.
 A suffix '.r' flag is used to indicate that the directory is ready to be built
 otherwise it is ignored. For example:
 <PRE>NESTED = Vector.r Matrix List.r</PRE> means that the directory Vector is
 built first and List is built second. Matrix is skipped.
</DD>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME="platform"></A>Platform Support</H3>

<P>
The default behaviour of the make system is to support all packages on all
platforms. The packages should be written in such a way that they can survive
the arrival of new software and hardware architectures quite easily. Software
written for a specific platform, like an operating system or a hardware card,
usually dies with the platform which often happens within 2-3 years of writing.
</P>

<P>
There is sometimes a necessity to maintain software for special hardware such
as a frame grabber, etc. For these exceptional circumstances, the following
variables are provided:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="SUPPORT_ONLY"></A><B>SUPPORT_ONLY</B></DT>
<DD>A list of architectures which are supported. If the contents of this
 variable clashes with DONOT_SUPPORT, then the architecture will be supported.
 If neither SUPPORT_ONLY or DONOT_SUPPORT is set, then all architectures are
 supported. For example: <PRE>SUPPORT_ONLY = sol2 alpha</PRE> means that the
 subtree of directories including the current one will be processed only for
 the Solaris2 and Alpha architectures.
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="DONOT_SUPPORT"></A><B>DONOT_SUPPORT</B></DT>
<DD>A list of architectures which is not supported. For example:
 <PRE>DONOT_SUPPORT = sgi</PRE> means that the subtree of directories including
 the current one will be processed for all architectures except Silicon
 Graphics.
</DD>
</UL>

<LI><DT><A NAME="REQUIRES"></A><B>REQUIRES</B></DT>
<DD>A space seperated list of features required to compile the module. For example:
 <PRE>REQUIRES = libGTK</PRE> means that this directory and its subdirectories
can only be compiled if resource libGTK is available. A list of available resources
is generated in the config.local.$(ARC) file and placed in the RESOURCES variable. <br>
Examples of possible values include: libAudioFile,libDV,libavc1394,libCurl,
libClipStationPro,libDMedia,devVideo4Linux.
</DD>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="source"></A>Source Files</H3>

<P>
The compilation of libraries and executables are controlled by the following
variables:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="MAINS"></A><B>MAINS</B></DT> <DD>All executables that are
installed in the $PROJECT_OUT/bin directory. The suffixes '.cc' or '.c'
control the calling of a compiler and a linker. The following suffixes are
expected:

<UL>
<li> <b> .cc </b> for executables compiled and linked by C++ compiler.
<li> <b> .c </b> for executables compiled and linked by C compiler.
<li> <b> .f </b> for executables compiled and linked by Fortran compiler.
<li> <b> .for</b> for executables compiled and linked by Fortran compiler.
</UL>

For example, <PRE>MAINS = rgbTool.cc matcher.c</PRE> will make two executables.
The first one, rgbTool.cc, is compiled using C++ compiler and the compilation
of the second executable, matcher.c, is done by the C compiler.

<P>
The names of executables in MAINS variable must be unique.
</P></DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="SOURCES"></A><B>SOURCES</B></DT>
<DD>All source files which are added to the library defined by the variable
 PLIB. The suffixes play the same role as in the variable MAINS.

<P>
The names of files in SOURCES variable should be unique to avoid
clashes of names during restructuring of libraries.  However, the
names MUST be unique in the library specified by the variable PLIB
(see below).</P> </DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="MUSTLINK"></A><B>MUSTLINK</B></DT>
<DD> Advanced users only. This is a list of source files that MUST be
linked when using a library. The suffixes play the same role as in the variable MAINS.

<P>
The name of files specified in MUSTLINK, must be unique with respect
to all other files specified in MUSTLINK throughout RAVL.  This directive
can be used to force files to be included into executables, where dependancies
alone would not caused it to be linked.   This mechanism is used where constructors
for global variables modify or add to global databases. An example of this is
the file format register in the RavlIO library.
</P>
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="HEADERS"></A><B>HEADERS</B></DT> <DD>All the public header
files, i.e. those which are needed globally.  They are exported to the
directory $PROJECT_OUT/include/$(PACKAGE), to make them available
to other.  E.g. if you have a file <code>headerfile.hh</code> to export, the
line will be

<pre>
PACKAGE = Ravl
HEADERS = headerfile.hh
</pre> 
Thus to #include the header file, you need to put: 
<pre>#include "Ravl/headerfile.hh"</pre> 

if PACKAGE is not set you can include headerfiles as normal.

(For a more structured global header file system, see <a
href="#PACKAGE">PACKAGE</a>.)  </DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="LOCALHEADERS"></A><B>LOCALHEADERS</B></DT> <DD>Header
files which are used only for compilation in the current directory. These
header files are not exported.  
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="PACKAGE"></A><B>PACKAGE</B></DT> <DD>Advanced users only.  The
name of the package to which the directory belongs. In fact, it is a part of
the subdirectory path where public header files are copied. For example,
<PRE>PACKAGE = Ravl/Surf3d</PRE> means that all public header files will be
copied into the directory $PROJECT_OUT/include/Ravl/Surf3d and a header file must
be included in an implementation file as

<PRE>#include "Ravl/Surf3d/Curve3d.hh"</PRE> 

The default value of PACKAGE variable is no special path, so header files are
place directly into $PROJECT_OUT/include.

<P>
<font size = +1>ATTENTION!!</font> For code intended for contribution to
RAVL. The directories defined by PACKAGE should be
agreed by a number of contributors, otherwise the whole system will finish with
hundreds of directories each containing a very few header files. Furthermore,
the variable should not be changed arbitrarily because it will break code
that depends on the library.
.
</P></DD>

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="libs"></A>Libraries</H3>

These variables control the generation and linking of libraries.

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="PLIB"></A><B>PLIB</B></DT>
<DD>Use this to give your library a name (hence it must take only one value):
<PRE>  PLIB = mylib</PRE>

It is the name of the library in which the modules specified by the variable
SOURCES are archived.  A unique name for each directory is recommended.
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="USESLIBS"></A><B>USESLIBS</B></DT> <DD>This is an unordered
list of the libraries needed to build the new library specified by PLIB.  Use
of this variable causes the automatic creation of a "defs" file called
(PLIB).def.  There are different ways of creating this list:
<ul>
<li>The easiest usage is simply to use the value "Auto":
<pre>
  USESLIBS = Auto
</pre>
This should automatically generate the required list of libraries for both
USESLIBS and PROGLIBS, without you even noticing.

<li>The previous usage will not pick up any libraries that don't have a
corresponding header file anywhere, which happens occasionally.  Likely
candidates are I/O libraries such as the "RavlImageIO" image I/O library.  Use
the "QLibs" tool (which is what makes the "Auto" method work) to print out
most of the library list for you; all you have to do then is locate and add the
missing ones.

<li>The traditional way was to create the list yourself, using the libraries
indicated in the class pages, e.g.: 
<PRE>
  USESLIBS = RavlCore RavlIO
</PRE>
You need only specify libraries you use explicitly; any others will be
automatically included.</ul>

 <P>
 ATTENTION: If this variable is set the .def file is ALWAYS automaticly
 generated. If LIBDEPS is set as well then this is used as the name of the
 generated file. if you have library which depends on nothing else, but you
 wish to set USESLIBS you can use the dummy library 'None'. Example,
 <PRE>
  USESLIBS = None
 </PRE>
<!-- For details on how .def files work see <a href="file://localhost/vol/vssp/local.sun4/Ravl/doc/html/RavlMake.html#LibDepFile">library dependencies file</a></P> -->
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="PROGLIBS"></A><B>PROGLIBS</B></DT> <DD>The name of the
libraries used to create executables specified in either MAINS or EXAMPLES that
are not already included with the USESLIBS variable.  Typically you would
include things like IO code which is not need for the PLIB library
itself. For example: <PRE>PROGLIBS = RavlImageIO </PRE> You can use the automatic
methods described under USESLIBS for PROGLIBS as well. <P> Normally all libraries specified
in PROGLIBS are required to exist to create the executables. This is not always ideal, particularly 
for some IO libraries (e.g. RavlDPDisplay RavlImgIOV4L ...) we want to include them if
they are available, but ignore them if the are not. This can be achieved by adding
.opt to the end of the library names, indicating they are optional. For example RavlImgIOV4L would be added as 'RavlImgIOV4L.opt' .     </DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="LIBDEPS"></A><B>LIBDEPS</B></DT>
<DD>
LIBDEPS is used to explicitly create references to libraries.  E.g. the
following entry in the defs.mk file would create a reference to an external 
library RavlImageFilter:
<pre>  LIBDEPS = RavlImageFilter.def</pre>
which could then be referenced in the normal way, e.g.:
<pre>  USESLIBS = RavlImageFilter</pre>
See the file <a href="../../../../../../lib/RAVL/libdep/RavlImageFilter.def">RavlImageFilter.def</a> itself to see what to put in it. 
<p>
This is used where the source for a library spans several directories, where each 
directory creates a .def file but the object files are are added to a single
library.

</DD><P>

<H3><A NAME="examples"></A>Example programs</H3>

<P>
The following two variables can be used for a specification of executables used
for a demonstration how to use packages or for their run-time checking.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="EXAMPLES"></A><B>EXAMPLES</B></DT> <DD>Contains the names of
source files demonstrating the use of the software in the directory.  They are
copied into the documentation area.  The example sources must be compilable; to
check compilation, include them temporarily in the "MAINS" list, e.g.:
<pre>
qm MAINS=example.cc
</pre>   
</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="TESTEXES"></A><B>TESTEXES</B></DT>
<DD>The list of executables testing runtime consistency of the software. They
 are compiled and run to test if they produce expected results.    The executables
should return 0 on success, non-zero on failure.  If the program doesn't exit
normally it will be treated as a failure.  Both stdout and stderr of the program are 
stored in a log during testing to help trace bugs.  Testing done using the 'qm test'.
</DD>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="special"></A>Special Files</H3>

<P>
The directory can contain special files which should be extracted from the
database of source files. They can be examples of data input, etc. The size of
these file should be kept to a minimum. The following variables can be used for
a specification of these file:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="LOCAL_FILES"></A><B>LOCAL_FILES</B></DT>
<DD>All files which do not fit to any other category of variables of defs.mk
 file. These file are extracted to the current directory from the database of
 sources and regularly updated.
</DD>
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="documentation"></A>Documentation</H3>

<P>
The documentation of packages is also propagated into the proper installation
directories. The following variables describe what kind of documentation the
files in the current directory have.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="EHT"></A><B>EHT</B></DT>
<DD>
List of EHT files for creating extra documentation for nodes in the tree. <p>
Nodes in the tree should be named for the path in the documentation tree. e.g. the extra
documentation for arrays has the name 'Containers.Arrays.eht'.
Executables MUST start with the prefix exe, followed by the name of
the executable, with a extention of '.eht' or '.html'.
<p>

</DD><P>
<LI><DT><A NAME="DOCNODE"></A><B>DOCNODE</B></DT>
<DD>Specifies additional files required by <b>EHT</b> files, ie images.</DD><P>
<LI><DT><A NAME="HTML"></A><B>HTML</B></DT>
<DD>Contains the names of documentation written in plain hypertext.</DD><P>
<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN1"></A><B>MAN1</B></DT>
<DD>Contains the names of files of manual pages of executables.</DD><P>
<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN3"></A><B>MAN3</B></DT>
<DD>Contains the names of manual pages describing library functions.</DD><P>
<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN5"></A><B>MAN5</B></DT>
<DD>Contains the names of manual pages describing format of files.</DD><P>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CHXX"></A><B>CHXX</B></DT>
<DD>
Extention expected for C++ header files. Defaults to '.hh'. Can be set in config.(arc) files
as well.
