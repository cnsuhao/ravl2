    The classes, functions and executables in this section have not been placed in the

    experimental or still in early development and should be used with
    caution.  You can place code in the documentation tree by
    setting the 'docentry' variable in the header or source file. e.g. 
    <pre>//! docentry="Ravl.Core.Misc"</pre>
