<!-- *************************** Main Page Text  *************************** -->

<P>
A docentry variable can be set in any class declaration or .eht file. It
specifies the location for that object to appear in the automatically generated
and formatted documentation tree.
</P>

<P>
The location in the tree is specified by giving a path name
relative to the root of the tree. Each node is separated by periods (.) and the
title of a node may contain spaces but not underline characters. The following
is an example entry which would put the object into the image processing
subsection of images:
</P>

<PRE>
//! docentry="Image.Image Processing"
</PRE>

<P>
It is quite legal for an object to appear in more than one location in the tree.
In this case, each path is provided in the same docentry variable, but separated
by semicolons, eg:
</P>

<PRE>
//! docentry="Algorithms.Numerical Methods.Optimisation;Algorithms.Optimisation"
</PRE>

<P>
If you refer to any nodes in the tree that do not already exist, then they will
be automatically created and appropriate menu options for subnodes will be
added. It is therefore important to ensure that you spell all the names
correctly, and where you are contributing in a common area, that you use one of
the predefined nodes of the <a href="../../../Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.html">current documentation tree</a>.
