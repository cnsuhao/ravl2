    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>These classes provide a framework for the implementation of Bayesian
    reasoning systems.  The background for this package can be found in <a
    href= "http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A modern
    Approach</a>, Chapter 14.</p>

    <h2>Basic concepts</h2>

    <p>
      The most basic is <a
      href="../Class/RavlProbN.VariableC.html">VariableC</a> which represents
      random variables of 3 flavours: continuous, boolean and discrete.  Next
      there is <a href="../Class/RavlProbN.VariablePropositionC.html">
      VariablePropositionC</a> which represents a proposition that a variable
      takes a particular value, again in three flavours. E.g. we could have
      <code>BooleanVariable=&lt;true,false&gt;</code>.  Then we can have a
      proposition <code>BooleanVariable=true</code>. </p>

    <p>
      Next there is a <a
      href="../Class/RavlProbN.VariableSetC.html">VariableSetC</a> which is
      pretty much just what it sounds like: it might be used for instance to
      describe the set of evidence variables. There is a corresponding <a
      href="../Class/RavlProbN.PropositionSetC.html">
      PropositionSetC</a> class.  Although this is related to a
      VariableSetC, it is not necessary for there to be a proposition for each
      variable in the set.  However, you can't have a proposition for a
      variable not in the set. This is used to describe things like observed
      events.  So for instance you could have a
      <code>VariableSetC=(MaryCalls,JohnCalls,Alarm)</code>, and you could
      have a corresponding PropositionSetC=(MaryCalls=true,JohnCalls=false).
      Note that the proposition set says nothing about Alarm.  </p>

    <p>
      So typically we want to evaluate something like
      <code>P(Burglary|MaryCalls,JohnCalls,Alarm)</code>.  That query would
      have to return a full joint distribution.  But to evaluate it you would
      need some numbers somewhere.  You could alternatively request
      <code>P(Burglary|MaryCalls=true,JohnCalls=false)</code> which might
      return e.g. &lt;0.284,0.716&gt;, i.e. the values for
      <code>Burglary=true</code> and <code>Burglary=false</code>.  These would
      be marginalised over <code>Alarm</code>.  Note the combination of
      variable sets and proposition sets.  Evaluating the P stuff involves
      quite a bit more infrastructure.</p>
 
    <h2>PDFs and CPDs</h2>    

    <p>
      Next we need to consider PDFs and CPDs (conditional probability density
      functions).  PDFs represent priors like <code>P(Burglary)</code>
      and<code> P(Alarm)</code>.....  OK, so a PDF is a function of a single
      variable and can be evaluated for any particular proposition of that
      variable, so using the PDF you could get the prior probability
      P(Burglary=true).  Of course you need a few concrete PDF implementations
      to handle the different types of variable, so there are boolean,
      discrete and continuous PDF classes.  The boolean and discrete just use
      tables; the continuous would need functions.  Currently there are
      uniform and normal continuous distributions, but more can be added.</p>

    <p>
      Then we also need conditional probability densities (CPDs).
      Essentially they are used to encode the table of values for e.g.  <code>
      P(Burglary|MaryCalls,JohnCalls,Alarm)</code>. A CPD has an output
      variable <code>Burglary</code> and a VariableSetC of parent variables
      Things get a bit hairy when you have continuous variables anywhere, but
      it is doable.  There a few variants of CPDs implemented currently, so
      they can work with a few combinations for now.  More combinations can be
      added later.</p>

    <h2>Bayesian Networks</h2>

    <p>
      Given this framework of PDFs and CPDs and variables and propositions
      we are in a position to define Bayesian Networks. A BN is defined by
      specifying an acyclic graph of nodes. Each node of the network is a
      VariableC and needs a CPD. The parent variable set defines the links of
      the graph. Note that special CPDs can define prior PDFs where the CPD
      parent variable set is empty.</p>
      
    <p>
      Once you have defined a BN then you can ask it to evaluate different
      probabilities etc and it will internally do all the marginalisation etc.
      I have created a <a
      href="../Class/RavlProbN.BayesianNetworkC.html">BayesianNetworkC</a>
      interface that will serve as the base class for all future
      implementations. Currently there is also a "simple" discrete
      implementation
      <a href="../Class/RavlProbN.BayesianNetworkSimpleC.html">
      BayesianNetworkSimpleC</a> that exhaustively computes the probabilities
      rather than finding a statistical estimation. See <a
      href="../../Examples/testBayesianNetwork.cc.html">testBayesianNetwork.cc</a>
      for a complete example. Note that it currently only works for discrete
      PDF queries. This needs to be fixed for continuous distributions.</p>
      
    <p>
      This simple solution doesn't scale well with increasing network 
      complexity and size so we would need to add a new concrete
      implementation based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
      However, the framework is pretty much all in place.</p>
