    <p>A couple of points to note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The transform used by the warper actually computes points in the
      reference image by transforming pixel coordinates from the warped image.
      Hence if the warper is constructed on a transform with for example a
      scale of 2 and positive rotation, the warped image will be &frac12; of
      the size of the reference image and rotated negatively with respect to
      it.</p></li> 
      
      <li><p>There are two possible coordinate systems to use when warping an
      image:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The coordinate system is at the top left-hand corner of pixel
          (0,0).</li>
          <li>The coordinate system is at the centre of pixel (0,0).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The default behaviour is the former.  Use the
        <code>SetMidPixelCorrection()</code> method with <code>correction =
        false</code> for the latter.</p> </li>
    </ul>
