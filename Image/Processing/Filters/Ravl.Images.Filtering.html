    <p> The center of the kernel for these operators is assumed to be the
    origin (0,0). So a 7 by 7 filter would be a 2d array with an index
    range from -3 to 3 in both dimensions.</p>
    <p> Most of these filters are area-based.  As a result, the default behaviour is that the resulting image is smaller than the original.  If this is not what is needed, the original image should be expanded before filtering, using one of the <a href="#ExtendImage">ExtendImage functions</a> below. </p>
