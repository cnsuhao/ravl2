    <p>The edges described here are the result of an edge detection process, i.e. they typically represent points of maximum intensity gradient.  Ultimately they are expressed as strigs of pixels.   This is in contrast to the region boundary representation in <a href="Ravl.Images.Boundaries.html">Boundaries</a></p>
