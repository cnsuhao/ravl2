    <p>RAVL includes a comprehensive mechanism for reading and writing
    objects from and to files in a uniform and transparent fashion.
    It is based around two global functions: <code>Load</code> and
    <code>Save</code>.  In particular, there is a set of routines to
    handle a variety of image file formats, together with the ability
    to convert between several different pixel representations.</p>
    
    <p> The generic load/save mechanism is described in <a
    href="Ravl.Core.IO.html">Ravl.Core.IO</a>.  In order to invoke the
    libraries specific to image I/O, you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> insert this header file:
	<pre>
#include "Ravl/IO.hh"
	</pre></li>
      
      <li> add this library in the <code>defs.mk</code>:
	<pre>
PROGLIBS = RavlImageIO ....
	</pre>
    </ul>
    
    <p> The generic load/save call can then be used in the <a
    href="Ravl.Core.IO.html">usual way</a>.  For an example of how to
    use the system with images see <a
    href="../../../examples/exImgIO.cc">exImgIO.cc</a>.  (Remember: to
    compile this example you'll need the "RavlImageIO" library.)
    </p>
    <p> To find what file formats and conversions are available, use the
      <code>conv</code> tool, with the following options:</p>
      
    <dl>
      <dt><code>-lf</code> - list all known file formats</dt>
      <dt><code>-lc</code> - list all known conversions</dt>
      <dt><code>-lt</code> - list all known classes (?)</dt>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Here's a summary of currently supported formats. Supported natively
    in ravl are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>pgm</b> Grey scale images.</li>
      <li><b>ppm</b> RGB colour images.</li>
      <li><b>pbm</b> Bit image</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By linking the RAVL library <b>RavlExtImgIO</b> which, uses various open source libraries you also get:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>jpeg</b> Lossy compressed images. Colour and grey scale. (Supports sequences stored in a single file.)</li>
      <li><b>png</b> Lossless compressed images. Colour and grey scale.</li>
      <li><b>tiff</b> Lossless compressed images.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <h3>Virtual files</h3>
	
    <p>If you want to pop up an image on the screen instead of writing
    to a file, or if you want to read an image directly from a camera,
    use the <a href="Ravl.Core.IO.Virtual_Files.html">virtual file
    system</a>.  To make it work, you will also need to include the
    RavlDPDisplay library:</p>

    <pre>PROGLIBS = RavlDPDisplay ....</pre>

    <h3>Creating image converters</h3>
	
    <p>If you wish to load and save your own image type as
    <code>ppm</code>, <code>pgm</code> or any other file format that
    is already supported, and the particular conversion you want is
    not currently available, it is straightforward to add one to the
    collection (currently in
    <code>Ravl/Image/ImageIO/ImgTypeCnv.cc)</code>.  Following is an
    example for converting a byte image into a double image.  For more
    information on writing converters see <a
    href="Ravl.Core.IO.html">Ravl.Core.IO</a></p>


	<pre>
ImageC&lt RealT&gt DPConvImageC<ByteT>T2RealImageCT(const ImageC&lt ByteT&gt &dat)  
{ 
  ImageC&lt RealT&gt ret(dat.Rectangle());
  for(Array2dIter2C&lt RealT,ByteT&gt it(ret,dat);it;it++) 
    it.Data1() = (RealT) it.Data2();
  return ret;
}

DP_REGISTER_CONVERSION(ImageC<ByteT>T2RealImageCT, 1);
    </pre>

    <p>The argument in the function call indicates (as a ratio of the
	number of bytes in the respective pixels) the amount of
	information lost in the conversion.  In this example, no
	information is lost, so the ratio is 1.  For double to char
	conversion, the ration would be 8.</p>
