: Graphical User Interface.

Tools for building graphical user interfaces.  These tools act
as wrappers for the 'C' GTK library.  The current version is very
incomplete, but growing.  Additional functions can be added on request. <p>

Probably the best way to learn to use this library is by looking at the examples.
The CanvasC,MenuC or ButtonC widgets are particularly good places to start.
