    <h1>Programming GUIs in RAVL</h1>

    <p>The principle is that you lay out "widgets" - things like
    buttons and canvases - in a window.  Then you hook up widgets to
    functions so that, when you for example press a button, a
    corresponding function gets called.</p>

    <p>You start by creating a window (using <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.WindowC.html">WindowC</a>).  On
    this you put widgets.  There are two kinds of widgets: control
    widgets and layout widgets.  Control widgets are things like
    buttons, sliders, menus, canvases, etc. that link to functions
    that actually perform tasks.  The layout widgets determine how the
    layout of the GUI looks. </p>

    <p>In principle you can only put one single widget in the main
    WindowC window.  In practice several of the layout
    widgets allow other widgets to be placed inside them.  For
    example, LBoxC  can contain an array of widgets,
    displayed either vertically or horizontally.  Hence you can
    structure your window (a bit like a Latex page).</p>

    <p>If you hit a button, select a menu item, or move the mouse
    across a canvas, you would I guess expect something to happen.
    For example in the case of the button, to do this, there is a <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.OS.Signals.html">Connect</a>
    function that associates the button class to the function that is
    to be executed, and to a signal that is used to provide a message
    at the time the button is pressed.  An illustration of the
    mechanism can be found in the code for the Button helper functions
    found towards the bottom of <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.GUI.Control.html">this page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>A "hands-on" way to learn to use this library is by looking
    at the examples for the <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.CanvasC.html">CanvasC</a>, <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.MenuC.html">MenuC</a> or <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.ButtonC.html">ButtonC</a> widgets.</p>

<h1> The GUI mechanism in RAVL </h1>

    <p> In Ravl, the GUI callback routines are run as a separate thread from
    the program that creates them.  The program thread may contain various
    commands for the GUI (add a row to a CList, move the cursor, etc.).  These
    commands are added to a queue, and the GUI thread executes them.  One
    reason why this is important is that in some of the GUI classes, you will
    see that there are two versions of some of the methods.  For example in <a
    href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.ButtonC.html">ButtonC</a> there are
    methods <code>ButtonC::SetLabel()</code> and
    <code>ButtonC::GUISetLabel()</code>.  <code>SetLabel()</code> is the one
    you use in the main program.  It will cause a request for
    <code>GUISetLabel()</code> to be added to the execution queue.  When the
    GUI thread reaches this function, the text will be added to the button.
    If you need to invoke a widget method within a callback routine, use the
    "GUI" version instead, i.e. in this case
    <code>ButtonC::GUISetLabel()</code>.
