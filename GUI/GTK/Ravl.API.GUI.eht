: Graphical User Interface.

Tools for building graphical user interfaces.  These tools act as
wrappers for the 'C' <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a> library.
The current version is not complete, additional functions will be
added on request. <p>

Newcomers to the RAVL GUI library should start with <a
href="../../../html/tutorial.html">this tutorial</a>.  For advanced
users, the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial">GTK tutorial</a>
 is also very helpful.<p>

Finally, users of the class <a href="../Auto/Basic/Class/RavlGUIN.CanvasC.html">CanvasC</a>
who want to use the colours might find
<a href="../../../html/canvas_colours.html">this colour grid</a> useful.
