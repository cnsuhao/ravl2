  <body>
Class wizard is program designed to help with writing and maintaining Ravl style 'big objects'. 

<p>
<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li> Uses the public part of the body class as reference to maintain the handle class.
<li> Modifies existing header files, no need for seperate header compilation stage. 
Default currently prefixes modified file with an underscore, use -p "" to replace original file.
<li> Works around any modifications made by the author.
<li> All methods and classes that are added are marked with '//!author:cwiz'
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Operations:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Create handle a method for each public body method. 
<li> Create handle constructors for each public constructor in the body class.
<li> If no handle class is found, creates the handle class and places it after the body class.
<li> Remove handle methods and constructors for which there are no body methods. (Only methods marked with '//!author:cwiz')
<li> Optionally will create stub functions for the .cc file with '-s' option.
</ul>
